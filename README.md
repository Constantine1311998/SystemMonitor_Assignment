System Monitor Library contains all the decoupled interfaces and OS specfic implementations for each available OS.
Current system I am using is windows. Therefore windows functionality has been tested. Used chatgpt and code assist for getting the implementation.
Linux system is just added for the sake of adding an implementation. I haven't tested this at any point.
